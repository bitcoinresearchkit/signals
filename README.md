# @solidjs/signals

Standalone Reactive implementation to serve as the basis of future (post 1.x) versions of SolidJS. This package aims to be core for Signals library made with rendering in mind so it may have more features and opinions than common Signals libraries, but are still necessary core to accomplish the type of capabilities we intend.

This is not ready for production and should be considered pre-alpha. This package is completely experimental and every release may be breaking. It is also not tuned for performance as of yet as we are still focusing on capability.
